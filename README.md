# Zelda Lists
Much like the student lists program, except this one uses recursion to make many of the functions work.

Made for Mr. Galbraith's C++ course at Sunset High School.

You can compile this project with the g++ compiler using the following command:

g++ -o run.exe main.cpp Student.cpp Node.o

If the Node.o file does not work, you can generate a new one using any Node.cpp file with the correct functionalities using:

g++ -c Node.cpp

If you are confused as to what the correct functionalities are, refer to my "Nhode" repository at "https://github.com/GreggZumbari/Nhode", or you can just look at the header file for Node (Node.h) right here in this repository.
